This directory contains some sample monitoring config for using the
'Prometheus' monitoring server against synapse.

To use it, first install prometheus by following the instructions at

  http://prometheus.io/

Then add a new job to the main prometheus.yml file:

  - job_name: "synapse"
    metrics_path: "/_synapse/metrics"
    # when endpoint uses https:
    scheme: "https"

    static_configs:
    - targets: ['SERVER.LOCATION:PORT']

To use `synapse.rules` add

    rule_files:
      - "/PATH/TO/synapse.rules"

Metrics are disabled by default when running synapse; they must be enabled
with the 'enable-metrics' option, either in the synapse config file or as a
command-line option.
