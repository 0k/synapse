Description: A Python package and its dependencies packaged up as DEB in an isolated virtualenv.
    .
    This is a distribution of "matrix-synapse" as a self-contained
    Python virtualenv wrapped into a Debian package ("omnibus" package,
    all passengers on board). The packaged virtualenv is kept in sync with
    the host's interpreter automatically.
    .
    See https://github.com/spotify/dh-virtualenv for more details.
