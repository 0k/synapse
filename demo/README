The demo start.sh will start three synapse servers on ports 8080, 8081 and 8082, with host names localhost:$port. This can be easily changed to `hostname`:$port in start.sh if required. 
It will also start a web server on port 8000 pointed at the webclient.

stop.sh will stop the synapse servers and the webclient.

clean.sh will delete the databases and log files.

To start a completely new set of servers, run:

    ./demo/stop.sh; ./demo/clean.sh && ./demo/start.sh


Logs and sqlitedb will be stored in demo/808{0,1,2}.{log,db}
