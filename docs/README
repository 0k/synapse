To test it out, run the test messaging app, passing in your synapse ID as the parameter, formatted as user@host:port.

mkdir dbs  # These should not be necessary as the dirs shoud already exist.
mkdir logs

PYTHONPATH=. python example/test_messaging.py user@matthew-vpn.openmarket.com:5000

Then, you can join a room; invite someone to the room, and message them:

join tng
invite tng erik@wingspar:5000
send tng hello world
