Terminology
===========

A list of definitions of specific terminology used among these documents.
These terms were originally taken from the server-server documentation, and may
not currently match the exact meanings used in other places; though as a
medium-term goal we should encourage the unification of this terminology.


Terms
=====

Context:
  A single human-level entity of interest (currently, a chat room)

Event:
  A record of activity that records a single thing that happened on to a context
  (currently, a chat room). These are the "chat messages" that Synapse makes
  available.
  [[NOTE(paul): The current server-server implementation calls these simply
  "messages" but the term is too ambiguous here; I've called them Events]]

Pagination:
  The process of synchronising historic state from one home server to another,
  to backfill the event storage so that scrollback can be presented to the
  client(s).

PDU (Protocol Delivery Unit):
  A message that relates to a single context, irrespective of the server that
  is communicating it. PDUs either encode a single Event, or a single State
  change.

State:
  A set of metadata maintained about a Context, which is replicated among the
  servers in addition to the history of Events.

Transaction:
  A message which relates to the communication between a given pair of servers.
