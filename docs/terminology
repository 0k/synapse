Terminology
===========

A list of definitions of specific terminology used among these documents.
These terms were originally taken from the server-server documentation, and may
not currently match the exact meanings used in other places; though as a
medium-term goal we should encourage the unification of this terminology.


Terms
=====

Context:
  A single human-level entity of interest (currently, a chat room)

Event:
  A record of activity that records a single thing that happened on to a context
  (currently, a chat room). These are the "chat messages" that Synapse makes
  available.
  [[NOTE(paul): The current server-server implementation calls these simply
  "messages" but the term is too ambiguous here; I've called them Events]]

Pagination:
  The process of synchronising historic state from one home server to another,
  to backfill the event storage so that scrollback can be presented to the
  client(s).

PDU (Protocol Delivery Unit):
  A message that relates to a single context, irrespective of the server that
  is communicating it. PDUs either encode a single Event, or a single State
  change. A PDU is referred to by its PDU Reference; the pair of its origin
  server and local ID from that server.

PDU ID:
  A local ID used to refer to a specific PDU from a given origin server. These
  IDs are opaque at the protocol level, but may optionally have some structured
  meaning within a given origin server or implementation.

PDU Origin:
  The name of the origin server that generated a given PDU. This may not be the
  server from which it has been received, due to the way they are copied around
  from server to server. The origin always records the original server that
  created it.

PDU Reference:
  The pair of PDU Origin and PDU ID, that together uniquely refers to a specific
  PDU.

State:
  A set of metadata maintained about a Context, which is replicated among the
  servers in addition to the history of Events.

Transaction:
  A message which relates to the communication between a given pair of servers.
